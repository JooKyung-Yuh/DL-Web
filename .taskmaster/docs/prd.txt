- **Why it's important**: Keeps users organized and motivated by tracking progress through their learning journey
- **How it works**: Drag-and-drop interface with filters, search, and quick navigation between papers

## Smart Reference System
- **What it does**: Enables instant navigation through citation links with bidirectional linking and backlink tracking

3. **Exploration Mode**: View knowledge graph → Click interesting node → Paper opens → Discover related papers → Add to reading list
4. **Progress Review**: Check sidebar for completion stats → Filter by status → Plan next reading session

## UI/UX Considerations
- Minimalist interface design to reduce cognitive load
- Dark/light mode for comfortable extended reading
- Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Accessibility features (screen reader support, adjustable fonts)
